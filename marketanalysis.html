                    <p>One billion people, or 15% of the world's population, experience some form of disability, with higher prevalence in developing countries.</p>
                    <p>People with disabilities face greater risks of unfavorable socioeconomic outcomes, such as lower education and employment levels, worse health outcomes, and higher poverty rates.</p>

                    <p>COVID-19 has exacerbated challenges for people with disabilities, affecting health, education, and access to services like meal programs and assistive technologies.</p>
                    <p>School closures during the pandemic deprived children with disabilities of essential programs and shifted the role of caregivers to teachers, exacerbating the digital divide.</p>

                    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">PORTER’S FIVE FORCES ANALYSIS:</h1>
                    <p>The Threat of New Entrants:</p>
                    <p>The threat of new entrants in the field of disability support and inclusion for The Building-Together Project is relatively low. Establishing an organization that caters to the needs of individuals with disabilities requires specialized knowledge, expertise, and resources. However, the project should remain vigilant for potential new entrants or disruptive innovations that could provide similar services or alternative approaches to addressing disability challenges.</p>
                    <p>Bargaining Power of Suppliers:</p>
                    <p>The bargaining power of suppliers in The Building-Together Project's context refers to the organizations and institutions that provide resources, equipment, and training for individuals with disabilities. The project may face challenges in negotiating favorable terms with suppliers if they have limited options or if suppliers hold significant market power. However, building strong partnerships and collaborations with suppliers can help mitigate this risk and ensure the availability of necessary resources.</p>
                    <p>Bargaining Power of Buyers:</p>
                    <p>The bargaining power of buyers, in this case, refers to the individuals with disabilities and the organizations that seek disability support services. The Building-Together Project aims to empower individuals with disabilities and provide them with the necessary skills and support to lead fulfilling lives. While individual buyers may have limited bargaining power due to their unique needs, the project should focus on delivering high-quality services and building strong relationships to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
                    <p>The threat of Substitutes:</p>
                    <p>The threat of substitutes for Building-Together Project's services can be relatively low. The project's focus on comprehensive support, specialized training, and entrepreneurial opportunities for individuals with disabilities creates a unique value proposition. However, alternative approaches or initiatives that address disability inclusion and support may emerge, posing a potential substitute threat. Continuous innovation, staying updated with industry trends, and delivering superior services will help mitigate this risk.</p>
                    <p>Competitive Rivalry:</p>
                    <p>The Building-Together Project operates in a competitive landscape where other organizations and initiatives are also addressing disability support and inclusion. Competitors may include similar non-profit organizations, government programs, or community-based initiatives. To differentiate itself, The Building-Together Project should emphasize its comprehensive approach, specialized training programs, international partnerships, and its unique vision of empowering individuals with disabilities to become self-sufficient and independent.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The Building-Together Project can leverage its vision, mission, and comprehensive approach to address the challenges and opportunities presented by Porter's Five Forces. By continuously monitoring and adapting to changes in the competitive landscape, building strong partnerships, and delivering high-quality services, the project can establish a strong market presence and make a meaningful impact in the field of disability support and inclusion. </p>

                    <p>SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. A SWOT analysis is a method for strategic planning that evaluates these four elements as they relate to our business objectives. The SWOT analysis provides us with an opportunity to examine the strengths and weaknesses we must address. It also allows us to examine the opportunities presented to us as well as potential threats. The following section helps demonstrate our marketing strategy:</p>
                    
                    <p>Strengths:</p>
                    <p>
                        <li>High level of experience: The owner of the business, Mrs. Annick Joelle Fotsi has adequate experience in the disability support and inclusion sector. </li>
                        <li>Good Business Reputation: The business will leverage the good reputation of excellent service delivery of the company. We will build an excellent customer base by offering top-notch services that will enhance our reputation.</li>
                        <li>Online Visibility: Our service will be accessible regardless of the client’s location through our upcoming website. This breaks the distance barrier and creates easy reach for our target market.</li>
                        <li>A clear vision of the market needs: We know what the people have been missing in the industry, and what keeps the disability support and inclusion industry system running and interesting. By doing this, we will create very loyal and passionate clients by offering them exclusive services with interesting choices.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>Weaknesses:</p>
                    <p>
                        <li>High Capital Requirements: It is no doubt there is a large cost attached to acquiring this kind of business. This could cause a strain in our growth stage.</li>
                        <li>Maintaining Image: There is a need for us to constantly be at the edge of competition as an alternative to adult care facilities, this may become a difficult task for us and threaten our existence in the industry.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>Opportunities:</p>
                    <p>
                        <li>Future Expansion: We have expansion plans and we will gain a reasonable market share as we capture the market strategically.</li>
                        <li>Additional Capital: The acquisition of capital, which will be invested in the business, is another opportunity for us and our growth.</li>
                        <li>The growing population of citizens.</li>
                    </p>
